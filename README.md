# WifiHotSpot-Manager-using-C++-for-Windows

Application is developed using C++ with CodeBlocks IDE.
Uses CLI Mode for handling all of the Wifi Hotspots managing such as to Create a new HotSpot,Change Password,See list of devices. etc.,

Note:
This appilcation works on Command line interface, so i dont recommend this for a person who hate CLI.
Very helpful for users use Windows 8 or below versions.
No need for Windows 10, Since its easier to create wifi hotspot and manage in it.


Any Further development to the code is appreciable!
